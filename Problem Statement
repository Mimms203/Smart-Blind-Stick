Problem Statement
Blind people can't easily recognize obstacles or stairs while using normal blind stick.
The blind traveler should depend on any other guide like blind cane , people information , trained dogs, etc.
About the 90% of the worlds visually impaired live in developing countries..
No safety features on the normal blind stick. 
Canâ€™t locate the location of the normal blind stick user when they are having an emergency problem or lost in a public area .
The walking stick cannot detect the distance that much more far away from the individual or the moving objects that moving around the corridor.

So I thought of making an advanced model of a blind stick which tries to address the above difficulties.
